# woolly-generator

This is a React Native application built using Expo.

My company kindly lets me study React Native on Friday afternoons. This is the project I'm working on.

To get it running:

- download the Expo cli by running `npm install -g expo-cli` in your terminal.
- clone this repo.
- run `expo start` in the project directory.
- choose whether you want it on an Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or your own device (the terminal will prompt you).
- enjoy Woolly.
- (well, that will be what you're able to do when it's finished.)
